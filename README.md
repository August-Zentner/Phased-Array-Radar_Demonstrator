# Phased-Array-Radar_Demonstrator
PRSEF Research project exploring a cheap 2 element phased array radar, built of of prior work done by Jon Kraft. 

J1PFFT is a code in which the transmit and receive arrays are steered manually (sweeping).

J2DPT is a code which tracks the largest reflector (active monopulse tracking).

J3MPT is a code which tracks a transmitter (passive monopusle tracking).
